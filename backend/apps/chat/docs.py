"""
API Documentation Schemas — Chat App.

This module contains all drf-spectacular ``extend_schema`` decorator instances
for the ``apps/chat`` API endpoints.

Architecture
------------
These schema objects are pure documentation metadata. They have absolutely zero
effect on runtime behaviour, authentication, matchmaking logic, or database
operations. They are applied as decorators inside ``views.py`` to keep
``views.py`` clean and focused exclusively on HTTP request handling.

Usage
-----
Import the required schema decorator into ``views.py`` and apply it directly
above the HTTP method::

    from .docs import start_chat_doc

    class StartChatAPIView(APIView):
        @start_chat_doc
        def post(self, request):
            ...

Maintenance
-----------
- Add new schema objects here when a new chat endpoint is created.
- Update the relevant schema object here when an endpoint contract changes
  (e.g. new request field, new response status code, changed description).
- Do NOT modify matchmaking logic, serializers, or views here.

Exports
-------
- ``start_chat_doc`` → StartChatAPIView.post
- ``end_chat_doc``   → EndChatAPIView.post
- ``report_doc``     → ReportAPIView.post

    Trigger the matchmaking flow for the current user.

    **Purpose**: Initiates an anonymous chat session. Matches the user with another waiting user, or places them in a queue if no one is available.
    **When frontend should call it**: When the user taps 'Find Chat'.
    **Authentication requirement**: Bearer Authentication (JWT required).
    **Security behaviour**: Authenticated user only.

    End a specific active chat room for the current user.

    **Purpose**: Terminates an ongoing private chat session.
    **When frontend should call it**: When the user clicks 'End Chat'.
    **Authentication requirement**: Bearer Authentication (JWT required).
    **Security behaviour**: Validates that the room exists and the authenticated user is actually a participant in that room.

    ### Request Fields
    * `room_id`: The UUID of the active chat room to end.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Report User
# Endpoint : POST /chat/report/

report_doc = extend_schema(
    tags=["Chat"],
    summary="Report User",
    description="""
    Submit a moderation report against the anonymous chat partner.

    **Purpose**: Allows a chat participant to report abusive, harmful, or inappropriate
    behaviour by their anonymous chat partner. The reported user is determined securely
    by the backend — the client never specifies who is being reported.

    **When frontend should call it**: When the user taps 'Report' during or after a chat session.

    **Authentication requirement**: Bearer Authentication (JWT required).

    **Security behaviour**:
    - Only authenticated participants of the specified room can file a report.
    - The backend derives the reported user from the room — clients cannot spoof this.
    - A user cannot report the same chat partner twice while a report is still pending.
    - Rate limited to 5 requests/minute to prevent mass-report abuse.

    ### Request Fields
    * `room_id`: UUID of the chat room in which the incident occurred.
    * `reason`: The category of the report. Must be one of: `spam`, `harassment`, `abusive_language`, `inappropriate_content`, `fake_identity`, `other`.
    * `description` *(optional)*: A detailed explanation of the incident.
    * `evidence_url` *(optional)*: A valid URL pointing to supporting evidence (e.g. a screenshot).
